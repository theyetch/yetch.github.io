    <h2>✦ Good website cumming soon ✦</h2>
    <p>What is up chat. My name is Yetch and I am a Certified Silly Guy<sup>®</sup>. This website isn't finished, and never will be, but I guarantee that it will do one of three things at some point in the future:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Get better</li>
      <li>Get worse</li>
      <li>Just... Get.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, having dispensed this wisdom, I feel entitled to present some more introduction in a different form.</p>
    <p>I do some things, and some I don't,
      <br>But those I do are here.
      <br>And though some will, and more will won't,
      <br>I hope you'll stay and peer.
    </p>
