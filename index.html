    <h1>Welcome!</h1>

    <p>This website serves as a little portfolio for my art. I try to stick to writing and some pixel art once in a while, but I'll inevitably end up with a bit of everything. WHile you're here, make sure to check out the Church of Gerald- maybe even apply!</p>

    <p>I've tried my best to organize the different things I do into subcategories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://yetch.neocities.org/writing.html">Writing</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://yetch.neocities.org/visual-art.html">Visual art</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://yetch.neocities.org/them-fangroup.html">Them fangroup</a></li>
      </ul>
