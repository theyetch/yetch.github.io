    <p>YETCH
      <br>Hail, trav’ler of these webbèd, wandered paths,
      <br>Who, spectral, haunts my clunky typèd code
      <br>With cur’ous eyes! Invite I thee: step off
      <br>The Ever-On-ing road you read this from.
      <br>A moment, leastways, for, perchance, thou’lt find
      <br>The bygone form and format I have used
      <br>Is pleasing to thine eyes.
      <br>
      <br>In iamb form and Shakespeare’s English send
      <br>I you well wishes for the pages ‘head.
      <br>And thank I thee, as well, for gen’rous time
      <br>Which thou hast lent today.
    </p>
