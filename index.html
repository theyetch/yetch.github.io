    <p>Behold, all ye who enter here,<br>
    A place of formats old;<br>
    Of blue (or purple) hyperlinks<br>
    And backgrounds bare and cold<br>
    <br>
    My work remains unfinished here;<br>
    There's much yet to be told.<br>
    But I stand now here with open arms,<br>
    And say to thee:<br>
    "Behold!"</p>

    <p>I've tried my best to organize the different things I do into subcategories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://yetch.net/conlang">Unnamed conlang</a></li>
    </ul>
