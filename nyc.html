    <h2>✦ Good metro cumming soon ✦</h2>
    <p>We in New York!!! This page is still under construction. I'm currently filming for a vlog, and editing is going to take a while, but I'll add that when it's all finished.</p>

    <h2>The Playlist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Duke Ellington - Take the "A" Train: as soon as we left the airport, we took the train in question to where we stayed.</li>
      <li>Michael Rodriguez - Pathways: the night of our arrival, we went to Small's jazz club with our hosts to see an hour-long set by the Michael Rodriguez quintet.</li>
    </ul>
