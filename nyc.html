    <h1>New York City</h1>

    <h2>✦ Good metro cumming soon ✦</h2>
    <p>We in New York!!! This page is still under construction. I'm currently filming for a vlog, and editing is going to take a while, but I'll add that when it's all finished.</p>

    <h2>The Playlist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Duke Ellington - Take the "A" Train: as soon as we left the airport, we took the train in question to where we stayed.</li>
      <li>Michael Rodriguez - Pathways: the night of our arrival, we went to Small's jazz club with our hosts to see an hour-long set by the Michael Rodriguez quintet, during which this original song was played.</li>
      <li>Santana - Treat: quesadillas in the Latino part of Harlem! Pretty self-explanatory with the Latin jazz.</li>
      <li>Aretha Franklin - Hello Sunshine: eclipse! It only got to 90%, but ah well. I was originally gonna add Black Hole Sun by Soundgarden, but decided to keep with the jazzier theme.</li>
      <li>SEATBELTS - Rush: for the rush of Times Square :)</li>
      <li>Pink Floyd - Money: I might change this later, as it breaks from the musical theme of the rest of the playlist, but I love Pink Floyd and this song perfectly represents Wall Street, which is why I added it.</li>
      <li>George Gershwin, Leonard Bernstein, Columia Symphony Orchestra - Rhapsody in Blue: as a theme for the city. We went to the Lincoln Center Spring Gala, and this song was mentioned as the president's inspiration for becoming a musician.</li>
      <li></li>
