    <h1>Untitled Conlang</h1>

    <p>All the rules and words I've made for my conlang! Keep in mind that<br>
    a) I really don't have many solid ideas yet, and that<br>
    b) rules and words are probably gonna get switched around pretty frequently.</p>

    <p>As stated on the homepage, this is the land of ancient web formatting (I'm too lazy to put effort into my code), and that extends to image embeds or any intuitive way of indexing things. Ctrl-F is your friend!</p>

  <h3>Alphabet, diphthongs, and monophthongs</h3>
  
  <h4>Script</h4>
  <img src="assets/conlang/script.png" width="512">
  <p>The script is based solely off of the archaic Etruscan script, used around 500 BC by the Etruscans in central and northern Italy. This was done partly to have some consistency and realism, and partly to just have something to work off of. I don't have any worldbuilding in mind surrounding this language, but if I did, the script could have evolved from the archaic Etruscan. An ancient Mediterranean civilization, perhaps?</p>

  <h3>Phonotactics</h3>
  
  <h4>Vowel order</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>No more than two vowels are allowed in a row within a single word part.</li>
    <li>When two word parts join, if the joint would cause vowels from different parts to occur next to each other, the two word parts are separated by a ʔ (glottal stop), marked by an apostrophe.
        For example, if the word parts "aki" and "iʒun" were combined into a single word, the result would be spelled "aki'iʒun" instead of "akiiʒun."
        However, in daily, informal speech, the two parts would probably be slurred, as the word has "i" on both sides of the joint. This would sound, and maybe be transcribed, as "akiʒun."
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Grammatical rules</h3>
  
  <h4>Plurals</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>When using the plural form of a noun, the part "[CHANGE LATER]" (multiple) is appended to the beginning, instead of an appendage on the end as with English.
        For example, instead of saying "dogs," one would say "[CHANGE LATER][CHANGE LATER], "
    </li>
    <li>To make clear a specific number of things, the appropriate number is added to the beginning, instead of the default plural part.
        For example, instead of saying "two dogs," one would say "[CHANGE LATER][CHANGE LATER]," which roughly translates to "two dog."
    </li>
  </ul>
