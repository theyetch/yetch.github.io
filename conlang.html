    <h1>Untitled Conlang</h1>

    <p>All the rules and words I've made for my conlang! Keep in mind that<br>
    a) I really don't have many solid ideas yet, and that<br>
    b) rules and words are probably gonna get switched around pretty frequently.</p>

    <p>As stated on the homepage, this is the land of ancient web formatting (I'm too lazy to put effort into my code), and that extends to image embeds or any intuitive way of indexing things. Ctrl-F is your friend!</p>
