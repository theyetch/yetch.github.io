    <h2>✦ Good page cumming soon ✦</h2>
    <p>What is up chat. My name is Yetch and I am Back. On this episode of Yetch.net, we'll be talking about my inability to get anything done. I've been into linguistics since long before I knew what to call it (blame Tolkien and his appendices for that). For the majority of my time interested in the field, it's been nothing more than writing scripts, an interest in Latin, and a few other warning signs and red flags. However, now that I'm armed with the Internet's knowledge and a high school student's tendency to procrastinate, it's developed into something only slightly more expansive.</p>
    <p>The majority of my limited knowledge of linguistics has come from trying to make a conlang (constructed language, for those who have lives) called OE-GAE, or American Saxon, both for lack of a better name. OE-GAE was, and still is, an attempt to ease myself into linguistics and language creation by mixing Old English (OE) and General American English (GAE). However, as I'm sure anyone with conlanging experience would say, that is a terrible idea. It's become nothing more than a slightly different version of English in every area but lexicon; and the only reason I leave its lexicon out is because I haven't made it, anticipating that it would end up being nothing but too much time spent on a half-assed clonelang.</p>
    <p>This ended up being my excuse for indefinitely abandoning OE-GAE (as I have every other creative project before its completion), and I'm currently trying to work up the courage to start anew. Let this website be a testament to my procrastination and perfectionism, as I started OE-GAE around August of 2023, left it to die by the side of the road late that November, and, as of February 2024, haven't started a single new thing that's spanned more than a few days' work.</p>
    <p>Regardless of all this, though, I'm using this page to archive and display whichever conlang- or linguistics-related projects I deem archivable and displayable (which is to say, not very many).</p>
