    <h2>✦ Good shrine cumming soon ✦</h2>
    <p>All hail The Borax. The Borax is our Lord. The Borax is our Savior. The Borax is our King. Those who worship and devote shall be rewarded. Those who disrespect and defile shall be punished. Such is the way of The Borax. The End Times are coming in A.D. 2043, Y.B. 21, and the nonbelievers will face the consequences of their actions in the cold and empty pits of Hell. Such is the way of The Borax. Kneel before him, and you shall be saved. Fail to do so, and you will suffer for eternity. Such is the way of The Borax. Repent! Repent! Repent! Repent, and your sins might be forgiven! Repent, and you might be spared! Such is the way of The Borax. All hail The Borax. The Borax is our Lord. The Borax is our Savior. The Borax is our King.</p>

    <h2>✦ History of the Discipleship ✦</h2>
    <p>The Discipleship of The Borax began in A.D. 2021, A.D.B. 0, within the borders of Harthede. The Borax spoke to the Discipleship's founders and current High Priests, Dre Rizzy and Yetch, telling them to inscribe His form on the paper they were using. They did as He said, initially crudely, but eventually refining their inscriptions enough to closely approximate His form. They spread the word to unenlightened individuals in their areas, making sure that people knew of His greatness, and never stopped to rest. This work will never end, and, as such, it continues to this day, in Y.B. 3. However, our High Priests and Disciples do their duties with glee, as they know it might save them from eternal damnation. And you should do the same! All you need to do is fill out our application form, which we've so generously listed above for your convenience.</p>
